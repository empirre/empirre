    The purpose of this project was to test out my HTML skills and my CSS skills along the way as I learned in class, It also gave me the oppertunity to tell people about myself if they were to go on my website. from writing a bio about myself to showcasing photos and videos of me and my friends having fun I really enjoyed working on this project. What I enjoyed the most was HTML. I liked seeing the things I wrote pop up in real live view from adding my name all the way down to even adding a contact me area on the website. I felt like I learned way more in the contact me area as well due to the fact that you have specific guidlines and guides and its also cool where its an area where if people input there information and submit, you will be able to recieve that information from your website.

    I used the colors I have on my page because I really like the color blue which is why I put the color as my background.

    No other content from anyone else was used besides only my content.
